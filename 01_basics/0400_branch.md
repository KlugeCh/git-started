# Gitflow

The following branching model is based on the Gitflow workflow. More details from its [original blog](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) and from the [Atlassian git tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow).

Before start let's clone a Git repo from GitHub:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/taitruong/git-started-examples                     Cloning into 'git-started-examples'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 20, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (20/20), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (11/11), done.
remote: Total 20 (delta 3), reused 17 (delta 3), pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (20/20), done.
```

Next let's check what tags the are defined and checkout the 0.2.1 release:
